# Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This project is an attempt to combine knowledge and code produced in these previous projects:

1. [Tile map](https://louisfoster.github.io/ios-test-level-map-1/)
2. [Camera harness](https://louisfoster.github.io/ios-test-camera-harness-1/)
3. [Input](https://louisfoster.github.io/ios-test-input-system-1/)

Additionally, I intent to build upon this to inform software architecture, patterns and scope. The result should be a simple navigable 3D environment, with easy to follow and maintainable code.
